## Overview:
In Eggdivers, players take control of Nyx and Umbra, two warriors who must defy the Manapati organization—an elite faction within Arcania that refuses to let the Golden Prophecy unfold. Determined to prevent their brother’s birth at all costs, Manapati wields both mystical arts and advanced technology to stop them.

Face relentless waves of enemies, each more challenging than the last, including special foes that force you to adapt your strategy. Choose from a roster of characters, each with a unique ability, and progressively upgrade your arsenal to enhance your combat prowess. Play solo or team up in online cooperative mode, hosting your own server to fight side by side and overcome deadly challenges.

Built in Unity 3D as a university project, Eggdivers delivers fast-paced action, strategic combat, and an ever-escalating battle for survival. Will you be able to defy fate and protect the future?
